# MindLoop

## About this project
MindLoop is an early-stage idea for an AI-based system.
The main goal is to help users think on their own instead of
getting direct answers from AI.

## Problem
Today, AI tools give instant answers.
Because of this, students slowly stop thinking deeply
and depend too much on AI.

## My idea
MindLoop will not give answers.
Instead, it will ask counter-questions and show different
points of view so the user can think and decide by themselves.

## How it works (basic flow)
1. User types a question or problem
2. The system asks reflective questions
3. The system shows two or more perspectives
4. The user thinks and chooses their own conclusion

## Who this is for
- Students
- Beginners
- Early learners

## Safety
This system will not respond to:
- Self-harm related questions
- Illegal activities
- Harmful or unethical content

## Current status
This is a documentation-first project.
I am currently focusing on idea clarity and design thinking.
